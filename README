BBS-Perm version 0.0.3

Want to build your own BBS client using Gtk2? Maybe BBS::Perm can help you.
Although BBS::Perm is still very, very young, it can help you now.
With BBS::Perm, you can:

1. have multi terminals at the same time, and quickly switch among them.
2. anti-idle
3. commit sth. from file or even command output directly.
4. get URIs and browse them quickly.
5. get some useful information of IPv4 addresses.
6. build your window layout freely.
7. use your own agent script.

see examples for some examples, ;-)

The name `Perm' is the mergence of `Perl' and `Term'
